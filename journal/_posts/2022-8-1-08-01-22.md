## NF4IP

I spent much of Monday trying to figure out how to download [NF4IP](https://github.com/Photon-AI-Research/NF4IP). However, the included instructions on there did not work. I tried to download all the files within a new conda environment. I cloned the repository and ran the setup.py file by doing

python -m pip install -e setup.py

which did not work. Instead I had to first download certain packages (like cement) from the requirements.txt file

python -m pip install -r requirements.txt

and then type

python -m pip install -e .

However, when I try to run the NF4IP generate command, I get an error saying that I do not have 'horovod' installed. When I try to install horovod, I get an error with failing to build the wheel and cmake.

## Fuchs Model Summary

On Tuesday, I had to proctor for Jared's students for their 1250 final exam. Here I am going to summarize the [Fuchs Model](https://www.nature.com/articles/nphys199) and [Tom's implementation](https://github.com/zhangt10086/SummerPhysicsResearch2022/blob/main/Fuchs_Synthetic_Data_v2.9_07_18_2022.ipynb) of it. 

The Fuchs Function will be denoted $f_F(\lambda, I_0, \Tau_{FWHM}, t, w_0)$ which is a function of wavelength, intensity, full-width half max of laser pulse, target thickness, and spot size (beam waist). First, the laser energy is calculated from the following formula

\begin{equation}
\frac{\pi}{2} I \frac{\omega_0^2}{2 \log(2)} \tau_{FWHM} \sqrt{\frac{\pi}{2}}
\end{equation}
