## NF4IP

I spent much of Monday trying to figure out how to download [NF4IP](https://github.com/Photon-AI-Research/NF4IP). However, the included instructions on there did not work. I tried to download all the files within a new conda environment. I cloned the repository and ran the setup.py file by doing

python -m pip install -e setup.py

which did not work. Instead I had to first download certain packages (like cement) from the requirements.txt file

python -m pip install -r requirements.txt

and then type

python -m pip install -e .

However, when I try to run the NF4IP generate command, I get an error saying that I do not have 'horovod' installed. When I try to install horovod, I get an error with failing to build the wheel and cmake.

## Fuchs Model Summary

On Tuesday, I had to proctor for Jared's students for their 1250 final exam. Here I am going to summarize the Fuchs Model and Tom's implementation of it.
