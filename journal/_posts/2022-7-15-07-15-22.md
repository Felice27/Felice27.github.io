This week, I created some script to automate the process of modifying the simulation parameters, running simulations, and extracting the data files. Chris told me I should leave the protons cold at 1eV and the electrons should be hotter. However, this introduces some problems because when the temperature difference is large, we see a large transfer in the energy from electrons to protons initially.
