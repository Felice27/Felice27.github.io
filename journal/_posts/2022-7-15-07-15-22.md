This week, I created some script to automate the process of modifying the simulation parameters, running simulations, and extracting the data files. Chris told me I should leave the protons cold at 1eV and the electrons should be hotter. However, this introduces some problems because when the temperature difference is large, we see a large transfer in the energy from electrons to protons initially.

This may also have to do with the fact that I picked a finite size target

(Insert results from full target here)

Additionally, the group wants Ricky and I to generate some data using the Fuchs model. I have downloaded Tom's notebook and read the Fuchs paper to understand the process of how he calculates the proton energies. I need to clarify what exactly it is that I should change in his model in order to generate some noisy data. 

Things to do: 

1. Using my scripts, I should be able to run simulations for efficiently, modifying different parameters. Should think about what parameters it is I want to modify
2. Work on generating Synthetic Data using Tom's Notebook with the Fuchs Model
