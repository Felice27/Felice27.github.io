# Testing Different GP Models

I trained a GP Model on 100, 1000, and 10000 point datasets (80% training 20% testing) and stored the models to a file. Then, I loaded in those models and used them to predict all the values of the 1000 point dataset. I also just plotted the untrained GP model prediction as well. Below, I have the results, where I've plotted the predicted max proton energy from the model in comparison to the exact max proton energy from the noiseless fuchs model (magenta, dashed) vs the thickness.

The light blue shaded region is the confidence region from the gaussian process model (2 $\sigma$ above and below where $\sigma$ is the standard deviation or noise at each point). We can see that the untrained model has a very low confidence, but all the rest of the models have very high confidence and produce good agreement with the fuchs model. Labeled on the graphs are the Noisy Error (percentage error between noisy fuchs model and GP model) and Exact Error (percentage error between noiseless fuchs model and GP model). We see that using fewer data points actually lowers the error with the noiseless fuchs model. This might be because if we are using too many data points, we are just overfitting to the noise, when in reality we want to focus on the underlying true noiseless model. 

I took the average value of the noise $\sigma$ and reported it on the graphs as well. We can see that $\sigma$ is close to the value of RMSE (root mean square error) which indicates that the noise level in the gaussian process model can be used as an estimate for the RMSE with the noisy fuchs data.
