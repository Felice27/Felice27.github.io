# Testing Different GP Models

I trained a GP Model on 100, 1000, and 10000 point datasets (80% training 20% testing) and stored the models to a file. Then, I loaded in those models and used them to predict all the values of the 1000 point dataset. I also just plotted the untrained GP model prediction as well. Below, I have the results, where I've plotted the predicted max proton energy from the model in comparison to the exact max proton energy from the noiseless fuchs model (magenta, dashed) vs the thickness.

The light blue shaded region is the confidence region from the gaussian process model (2 $\sigma$ above and below where $\sigma$ is the standard deviation or noise at each point). We can see that the untrained model has a very low confidence, but all the rest of the models have very high confidence and produce good agreement with the fuchs model. Labeled on the graphs are the Noisy Error (percentage error between noisy fuchs model and GP model) and Exact Error (percentage error between noiseless fuchs model and GP model). We see that using fewer data points actually lowers the error with the noiseless fuchs model. This might be because if we are using too many data points, we are just overfitting to the noise, when in reality we want to focus on the underlying true noiseless model. 

I took the average value of the noise $\sigma$ and reported it on the graphs as well. We can see that $\sigma$ is close to the value of RMSE (root mean square error) which indicates that the noise level in the gaussian process model can be used as an estimate for the RMSE with the noisy fuchs data. Additionally, I converted this to a percent error estimate by dividing $\sigma$ by the max proton energy prediction from the model, taking the average at each point, and multiplying by $\sqrt{\frac{2}{\pi}}$ for the conversion from gaussian error to MAPE.


# Finding better SVR params

I had thought that the SVR was not running very efficiently, since the Gaussian Process was doing much better when I didn't have a reason to suspect it should do much better. I changed some of the SVR hyperparameters as follows: 

- Kernel: Poly $\rightarrow$ RBF
- Tolerance: 0.001 $\rightarrow$ 0.01
- Gamma: auto $\rightarrow$ scale
- C: 10 $\rightarrow$ 1

The change to the RBF kernel made a large difference, as well as lowering the tolerance for the stopping criterion. I just changed Gamma and C back to their default values that the [rapids SVR](https://docs.rapids.ai/api/cuml/stable/api/#support-vector-machines) algorithm uses. In doing so, I found the SVR to train the Fuchs Data very fast: 100,000 training points in less than 10 seconds (9.96s).

with almost non-existent percent error

This easily clears the goal of training 100,000 training points in less than 100 seconds. 

# How to use Git on OSC

To seamlessly transition from working on OSC and working on my personal computer, I spent some time looking up how to use Git. First, on OSC, I create an SSH key by typing in 

> ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C ronak.n.desai@outlook.com

and I chose not to enter a password. Then, I typed in 

> eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"

to get the the following output: $\texttt{Agent pid 12889}$


We should now have a folder created (in the location $\texttt{~/.ssh/}$). In this folder, we want to create a file called $\texttt{config}$ using 

> vim ~/.ssh/config

and in this file, we type in 

$\texttt{Host*} \\$
  $\quad \texttt{AddKeysToAgent yes} \\$
  $\quad \texttt{IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id\_ed25519}$
  
and then type the command

> ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub

Then, on GitHub, go to Settings $\rightarrow$ SSH and GPG Keys $\rightarrow$ New SSH Key. The title can be anything. In the Key Textbox, copy and paste in the contents of \texttt{id_\ed25519.pub}. Then, on the OSC terminal, type

> ssh -T git@github.com

and say yes to the prompt. At this point, we should be set up with SSH. To clone a GitHub repo, we go to a GitHub repository page and click Code $\rightarrow$ SSH and copy to clipboard. then we type in the OSC terminal 

> git clone clipboard

where clipboard is replaced with what we just copied. By default, we will have just copied the master branch. To download another branch, we use the \texttt{checkout command}

> git checkout branch-name

will switch to a different branch and 

> git branch

will list the available branches to choose from that are currently downloaded on the local (on OSC) repository.
