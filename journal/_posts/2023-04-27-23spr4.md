# Testing Different GP Models

I trained a GP Model on 100, 1000, and 10000 point datasets (80% training 20% testing) and stored the models to a file. Then, I loaded in those models and used them to predict all the values of the 1000 point dataset. I also just plotted the untrained GP model prediction as well. Below, I have the results, where I've plotted the predicted max proton energy from the model in comparison to the exact max proton energy from the noiseless fuchs model (magenta, dashed).
