I was busy moving apartments this week while Ricky went ahead and generated some synthetic Data using the Fuchs model with added noise.

Last week, I found that it makes a big difference whether we fix the proton temperature to be low at 1eV or to be equal to the higher electron temperature. For example: 

Here is a plot (10ppc) using the same proton and electron initial temperature.

Here, we see this delay in heating to achieve the same heating rate of change. However, when we set the proton temp to 1eV, we get something different (This sim had 50ppc instead of 10ppc, but the same conclusion should be reached).
