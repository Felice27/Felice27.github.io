# Model Comparison All Sims

I took the three models: Arber, Alpha, and Ratio and fit the Alpha and Ratio Models with all the simulation data at once. Then, I created some plots that show how well each of these models compared in comparison to results from the PIC sim. 

The Alpha Model is given as ...

with the Arber Model being a specific prediction of 

This first plot is the amount of heating predicted during the full 1 ps of simulation. The magenta dashed line shows the result of the PIC simulation. The red, green, and blue dotted lines are the arber, alpha, and ratio models respectively. On the graph I put blue vertical lines to group the simulations by constant debye ratio with the numerical value of the debye ratio labeled in the corresponding region in the graph.

Next, I plotted the heating prediction with the PIC simulation heating subtracted out. As a result, $\Delta T = 0$ means that the model matches up exactly to the PIC simulation.

Finally, I plotted the above differences as a percentage of the PIC simulation result.
