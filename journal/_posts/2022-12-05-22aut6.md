# Arber Formula from Hockney's Empirical Investigations
Under the section **Modified Arber Formula** [here](https://ronak-n-desai.github.io/osunotebook/22aut2/), I show how Arber comes up with his formula for the amount of heating. This applies in d=2 dimensions, but if we want to consider d=1 or d=3 dimensions, we would modify this to be what I called the **Alpha Model** shown [here](https://ronak-n-desai.github.io/osunotebook/22aut1/). From now on, I will just refer to it as the **Generalized Arber Model**. The Generalized Arber Model Predicts the Amount of Heating as

\begin{equation}
\frac{dT_{eV}}{dt_{ps}} \equiv \Delta T_{GA}(d) = C_H \frac{T_{0,eV}^{1 - d/2} \Delta x_{nm}^d n_{23}^{(d + 1)/2}}{n_{ppc}} \label{eq:arber}
\end{equation}

To be more explicit, this would be 

$$
\begin{equation}
\Delta T_{GA} = \begin{cases}
\frac{T_{0,eV}^{1/2} \Delta x_{nm} n_{23} }{n_{ppc}} &\mbox{ if } d = 1 \\
\frac{\Delta x_{nm}^2 n_{23}^{3/2} }{n_{ppc}} &\mbox{ if } d = 2 \\
\frac{\Delta x_{nm}^3 n_{23}^2 }{T_{0,eV}^{1/2} n_{ppc}} &\mbox{ if } d = 3 
\end{equation}
$$

# Deriving Heating Model from Electric Field Fluctuations

[Here](https://ronak-n-desai.github.io/osunotebook/22aut5/) I considered the effect of the electric field fluctuations in time and how it would impact the amount of numerical heating. I derived a formula for the 2D case there, but more generally for d dimensions, we get a formula very similar to the Generalized Arber Formula, but with an extra multiplicative factor dependent on some dimensionless quantity $u_{max} = k_{max} \lambda_D$. 


$$
\begin{equation}
  \Delta T_{EF}(d) \equiv \Delta T_{GA}(d) \times 
  \begin{cases}
  \arctan(u_{max}) &\mbox{ if }  d = 1 \\
  \log(1 + u_{max}^2) &\mbox{ if }  d = 2 \\
  (u_{max} - \arctan(u_{max})) &\mbox{ if }  d = 3
  \end{cases}
\end{equation}
$$

where $k_{max}$ is the maximum relevant wave number in the problem of interest. In the finite mesh PIC model, Hockney claims that $k_{max} = \frac{\pi}{\Delta x}$
