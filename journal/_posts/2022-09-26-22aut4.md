# Obtaining Ricky's Data
Ricky's Simulations are located in his scratch directory at the following location on OSC: 

> /fs/scratch/PAS1066/oropeza/Sim_2D_SinglePulse/round_target/5_mJ/no_laser

He has simulations that vary the number of particles per cell for electrons, protons, (singly ionized) carbon, and (singly ionized) oxygen. The numbers he has are seemingly random but they are generated by a [Sobol Sequence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sobol_sequence) that tries to pick values that would sample the parameter space well. 

The temperature (and absorption) data are stored in the diagnostic files designated diag####.sdf.
