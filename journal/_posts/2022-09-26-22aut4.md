# Ricky's No Laser Data
Ricky's Simulations are located in his scratch directory at the following location on OSC: 

> /fs/scratch/PAS1066/oropeza/Sim_2D_SinglePulse/round_target/5_mJ/no_laser

He has simulations that vary the number of particles per cell for electrons, protons, (singly ionized) carbon, and (singly ionized) oxygen. The numbers he has are seemingly random but they are generated by a [Sobol Sequence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sobol_sequence) that tries to pick values that would sample the parameter space well. 

The simulation set up is as follows: There is a 2800 x 2800 (28 x 28 micron) 2D grid with open boundary conditions of cell size $\Delta x = 10 $ nm. The target is angled upwards at 45 degrees in the center of the simulation volume with thickness $l_x = 168 $ nm and length $l_y = 25 \mu $ m. At the ends of the target, it is rounded off by appending a semi-circle of radius $l_x = 168 $ nm. Below, this is drawn to scale (where each cell in this picture is 1 $\mu$ m so that each cell represents 100 x 100 simulation cells).

This Target is Liquid Ethylene Glycol with the chemical formula (CH$_2$OH)$_2$ with a number density of $1.0 \times 10^{28} \frac{1}{m^3}$. His simulations assume each of the particles are singly ionized at the start which would mean that there are the following number of particles per Ethylene Glycol: C+ (2), O+ (2) , H+ (6) e- (10). Here, H+ is simply just a proton. This would mean that the initial number densities of the particles in the target are: $n_C = 2e28, n_O = 2e28, n_p = 6e28, n_e = 1e29 \frac{1}{m^3}$. The simulation is ran from 0 to 500 fs without any laser being turned on with the initial ion temperatures set to 1eV and the initial electron temperature at either 1, 100, or 1000 eV. 

Ricky outputs different quantities according to the input decks. The energy (and absorption) data are stored in the diagnostic files designated 'diag####.sdf' which are outputted every 1fs. The particle weights are outputted in the 'p####.sdf' files which are outputted every 10 fs. The carbons and oxygens are getting ionized throughout the simulation which creates new particles define in EPOCH. In the input deck, these particles are referred to as Oplus and Cplus when singly ionized and Oplusi and Cplusj where $i \in {1, 2, \ldots, 7}$ and $i \in {1, \ldots, 5}$ for higher ionizations of Oxygen and Carbon. The singly ionized state would correspond to $i = j = 0$ but epoch does not append a 0 on the name. This is important because in obtaining the total energy in ions, we need to take a weighted sum:

\begin{equation}
E = \frac{\sum_{i=0}^k N_i * E_i}{N}
\end{equation}

where $N_i$ is the number of ions in a particular ionized state $i$ and $E_i$ is the total energy in ions in the state $i$.
