# Ricky's No Laser Data
Ricky's Simulations are located in his scratch directory at the following location on OSC: 

> /fs/scratch/PAS1066/oropeza/Sim_2D_SinglePulse/round_target/5_mJ/no_laser

He has simulations that vary the number of particles per cell for electrons, protons, (singly ionized) carbon, and (singly ionized) oxygen. The numbers he has are seemingly random but they are generated by a [Sobol Sequence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sobol_sequence) that tries to pick values that would sample the parameter space well. 

The simulation set up is as follows: There is a 2800 x 2800 (28 x 28 micron) 2D grid with open boundary conditions of cell size $\Delta x = 10 $ nm. The target is angled upwards at 45 degrees in the center of the simulation volume with thickness $l_x = 168 $ nm and length $l_y = 25 \mu $ m. At the ends of the target, it is rounded off by appending a semi-circle of radius $l_x = 168 $ nm. Below, this is drawn to scale (where each cell in this picture is 1 $\mu$ m so that it represents 100 x 100 simulation cells).

This Target is Liquid Ethylene Glycol with the chemical formula (CH$_2$OH)$_2$ with a number density of $1.0 \times 10^{28} \frac{1}{m^3}$. 

The temperature (and absorption) data are stored in the diagnostic files designated 'diag####.sdf'.
