I was busy moving apartments this week while Ricky went ahead and generated some synthetic Data using the Fuchs model with added noise.

Last week, I found that it makes a big difference whether we fix the proton temperature to be low at 1eV or to be equal to the higher electron temperature. For example (using sims where there is no vacuum): 

Here is a plot (10ppc) of the electron temperature using the same proton and electron initial temperature.

Here, we see this delay in heating to achieve the same heating rate of change. However, when we set the proton temp to 1eV, we get something slightly different.

So, it seems that these heating results would depend on whether we set the proton and electron temperature equal.
