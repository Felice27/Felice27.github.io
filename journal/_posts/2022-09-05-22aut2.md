# Electric Field Fluctuations

From the 1971 Hockney Paper, there was also a section that described the time average of the squared E-field fluctuations with respect to the particle kinetic energy. This is important because we know that the [squared field fluctuations are related to numerical heating](https://ronak-n-desai.github.io/osunotebook/22sum7/). 

Hockney's calculation sdtarts from the work by Montgomery and Tidman Ch. 8 (Insert here)

Hockneye arrives at 

\begin{equation}
\frac{\langle E^2 \rangle}{8 \pi} = \frac{kT}{2} \int \int_{-\infty}^{+\infty} \frac{d k_x d k_y}{(2 \pi)^2} \frac{1}{(1 + (k_x^2 + k_y^2) \lambda_D^2)}
\end{equation}

and in 2D, $kT = mv_{th}^2$ and if we let $u = k \lambda_D$ (where $k$ is the wavenumber and not the boltzmann constant) we can convert this to an integral in polar coordinates and arrive at

\begin{equation}
\frac{\langle E^2 \rangle / 8 \pi}{n m v_{th}^2} = \frac{1}{16 \pi} \text{Log} \(\frac{1 + u_{max}^2}{1+u_{min}^2}\) \frac{1}{n \lambda_D^2}
\end{equation}

In our PIC sims, $n$ is the macro-particle density per unit area and $u_{max} = \pi (\lambda_D / \Delta x)$ and $u_{min} = (2 \pi / N_x)(\lambda_D / \Delta x)$ would be the limits of the integral based on the relevant length scales in the simulation grid.
