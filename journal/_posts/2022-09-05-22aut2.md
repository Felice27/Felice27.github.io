# Electric Field Fluctuations

From the 1971 Hockney Paper, there was also a section that described the time average of the squared E-field fluctuations with respect to the particle kinetic energy. This is important because we know that the [squared field fluctuations are related to numerical heating](https://ronak-n-desai.github.io/osunotebook/22sum7/). 

Hockney's calculation starts from the work by Montgomery and Tidman Ch. 8. I borrowed this book from the library and tried to understand where he was coming from, but it didn't really make any sense to me. It involved auto-correlation functions and moving to the frequency domain among other things. 

Hockney arrives at 

\begin{equation}
\frac{\langle E^2 \rangle}{8 \pi} = \frac{k_B T}{2} \int \int_{-\infty}^{+\infty} \frac{d k_x d k_y}{(2 \pi)^2} \frac{1}{(1 + (k_x^2 + k_y^2) \lambda_D^2)}
\end{equation}

and in 2D, $k_B T = mv_{th}^2$ and if we let $u = k \lambda_D$ (where $k$ is the wavenumber and not the boltzmann constant) we can convert this to an integral in polar coordinates and arrive at

\begin{equation}
\frac{\langle E^2 \rangle / 8 \pi}{n m v_{th}^2} = \frac{1}{16 \pi} \text{Log} \(\frac{1 + u_{max}^2}{1+u_{min}^2}\) \frac{1}{n \lambda_D^2}
\end{equation}

In our PIC sims, $n$ is the macro-particle density per unit area and $u_{max} = \pi (\lambda_D / \Delta x)$ and $u_{min} = (2 \pi / N_x)(\lambda_D / \Delta x)$ would be the limits of the integral based on the relevant length scales in the simulation grid. If we plug in these limits, we would get

\begin{equation}
\frac{\langle E^2 \rangle / 8 \pi}{n m v_{th}^2} = \frac{1}{16 \pi} \text{Log} \(\frac{1 + (\pi r)^2}{1+(2 \pi r / N_x)^2}\) \frac{1}{n \lambda_D^2}
\end{equation}

where $r = \lambda_D / \Delta x$ is the debye ratio.

However, I have an issue with this equation. Let's say we fix the Debye Length and number density to some value. Then, we can plot these E-field fluctuations (ignoring the constants out front) as a function of only the debye ratio.

Above, I have plotted this function where the variable $x$ is the debye ratio. We can see as the debye ratio increases, the amount of heating also increases monotonically. This is not what we observe however in our sims, so I don't think that this would be a good model. However, we said $n$ is the density per unit area, but if we use that as the density per area of one grid cell, then we would get a plot like

Which has similar behavior to what we expect. When the debye ratio is close to zero, the heating plateaus to some amount instead of increasing to infinity. And the heating goes as 1 over the square of the debye ratio when the ratio is close to 1. Also, instead of the Log formula, we can use $(x+1)^{-2}$ where x is proportional to the debye ratio. Below, I have plotted these two as a rough comparison:

The reason I compare thse two formulas is that they have the same functional form for $x \gg 1$ and $x \ll 1$. So, if we were to write out the full formula for the heating for both of these sims, we would get

\begin{equation}
\frac{dT}{dt} \propto \text{Log} \(\frac{1 + (\pi r)^2}{1+(2 \pi r / N_x)^2}\) \frac{1}{n_{ppc} r^2}
\end{equation}

and 

\begin{equation}
\frac{dT}{dt} \propto \(\frac{\Delta x}{\Delta x + \lambda_D} \)^2 \frac{1}{n_{ppc}}= \(\frac{1}{1 + r} \)^2 \frac{1}{n_{ppc}}
\end{equation}

where we would just need to fit some specific constant of proportionality.

# Model Comparisons

After doing implementing these models, I realized that the models as is would definitely not work. That is because both of these new models are only dependent on the debye ratio and nothing else. I would group my simulations according to constant debye ratio, so these models would just naively predict a constant value for the heating for some debye ratio. However, we know this type of model is only adequate when the debye ratio is really small. When the debye ratio is closer to 1, we know this constant heating is not what is going on. 

For example, I have the absolute amount of heating in (eV) displayed below for the four models (when $\Delta x = 3$ nm)

This was the set of simulations that gave the best results for the $\alpha$-model and we can clearly see that the log or ratio model is definitely not adequate.
