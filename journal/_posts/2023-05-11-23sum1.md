# Modifying Tom's Log Scaling
In Tom's Process class, he pre-processed the intensity and three output energies in the following way. First, he divided each data point value by some scale factor that is somewhat around the typical values in the dataset. As an example from his file $\texttt{Model_Tuning_OSC_35_Epochs_CSV.py}$, he used ${1e19, 1e0, 1e8, 1e-1}$ for the intensity, max energy, total energy, and average energy scales. Then he simply took a natural logarithm of the data. The other two input variables (thickness and focal distance) were left unchanged. To me, this seems a problem because it is not very standardized. The typical approach to preprocessing involves something like $\texttt{StandardScaler}$ which normalizes the data points by subtracting by a mean and dividing by a standard deviation. If we are going to log the dataset, we should do it before the standard scaler transformation is applied.
