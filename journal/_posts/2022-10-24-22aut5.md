# Deriving Heating Model from E Field Fluctuations

[Previously](https://ronak-n-desai.github.io/osunotebook/22aut2/) I have tried to consider the Hockney calculations regarding the E-Field Fluctuations, but I did not fully examine how this would turn into a heating model. Here, I will finish the calculation. In the Hockney 1971 paper, they state a formula for the time-averaged squared electric field fluctuations (which comes from Plasma Kinetic Theory by Montgomery and Tidman Ch. 8.2)

\begin{equation} \frac{\langle E^2 \rangle}{8 \pi} = \frac{k_B T}{2} \int \int_{-\infty}^{+\infty} \frac{d k_x d k_y}{(2 \pi)^2} \frac{1}{(1 + (k_x^2 + k_y^2) \lambda_D^2)} \end{equation}

which is in units of energy per unit volume. We can convert this integral to polar coordinates by letting $k = \sqrt{k_x^2 + k_y^2}$ and integrating with respect to $k \cdot dk \cdot d\phi$. Also, we can convert the expression from CGS to SI Units

\begin{equation}
\frac{\epsilon_0 \langle E^2 \rangle}{2} = \frac{k_B T}{4 \pi} \int_0^\infty \frac{k dk}{1 + k^2 \lambda_D^2}
\end{equation}

To solve this integral, we let $u \equiv k \lambda_D$ to get

\begin{equation}
\langle E^2 \rangle = \frac{k_B T}{2 \pi \epsilon_0 \lambda_D^2} \int_0^\infty \frac{u du}{1 + u^2}
\end{equation}

which diverges at infinity, so we set limits to the integral 0 and $u_{max}$ which correspond to the maximum relevant wavenumber in our simulation. This can be solved analytically as 

\begin{equation}
\langle E^2 \rangle = \frac{k_B T}{4 \pi \epsilon_0 \lambda_D^2} \text{Log}(1 + u_max^2) \label{eq:e2}
\end{equation}

Here, $u_max = 2 \pi \frac{\lambda_D}{\Delta x} \times R$ where $R$ is some multiplicative factor that tells us where to implement our cutoff. $R = 1$ corresponds to saying that the maximum wavenumber considered is limited the the cell size: $k_max = \frac{2 \pi}{\Delta x}$. 

Also, from the Hockney 1971 Paper, they give an estimate of how the squared electric field fluctuations contribute to the kinetic energy increase of one macro particle

\begin{equation}
\Delta KE = \frac{1}{2} m \langle \Delta v^2 \rangle  = \frac{q^2}{m} \langle E^2 \rangle \tau_{CORR} t
\end{equation}

where we can identify $\tau_{CORR} = \frac{2 \pi}{\omega_{pe}}$ with the plasma period and we already have $\langle E^2 \rangle$. Additionally, we can express the charge of one macroparticle as $q = e \frac{N}{N_{mac}} = \frac{e n}{n_{mac}} = \frac{e n \Delta x^2}{n_{ppc}}$ Combining this all together, we will get 

\begin{equation}
\Delta KE = (\frac{e}{m_e}) \frac{e n \Delta x^2}{n_{ppc}} \frac{k_B T}{4 \pi \epsilon_0 \lambda_D^2} \text{Log}(1 + u_max^2) \frac{2 \pi}{\omega_{pe}} t 
\end{equation}

now, we can substitute the expressions for the plasma oscillation frequency and debye length to arrive at 

\begin{equation}
\Delta KE = \frac{n_e^{3/2} \Delta x^2}{n_{ppc}} \text{Log}(1 + u_{max}^2) \sqrt{\frac{e^6}{4 m_e \epsilon_0^3}
\end{equation}

From here, I can do the same procedure I did with the arber formula and let $n \rightarrow 10^{29} n_{23}$, $\Delta x \rightarrow 10^{-9} \Deltax x_{nm}$, and $t \rightarrow 10^{-12} t_{ps}$ to get 

\begin{equation}
\frac{\Delta T_{eV}}{\Delta t_{ps}} = (1.07 \times 10^7 eV) \frac{n_{23}^{3/2} \Delta x_{nm}^2}{n_{ppc}} \text{Log}(1 + u_max^2)
\end{equation}

which, to me, does not lines up
