These pictures show how the heating seems to have the same rate of change regardless of initial temperature. However, we see at lower temperatures, there is a longer delay until when linear heating is reached. Maybe this is because the thermal velocity of electrons is too low for the low temperature simulations and is not able to sufficiently move around in the simulation volume in the given amount of time to cause heating. 

Things to do: 

\begin{itemize}

\item Try to understand how Hockney came up with heating time estimates from \emph{Computer Simulation using Particles}

\end{itemize}
