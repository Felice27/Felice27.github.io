This image shows the amount of heating (eV) in 1 ps of simulation time. 

The parameters are as follows: 

* Nx = Ny = 20
* PPC = 10
* Triangle Shape Function
* Periodic BC
* n = 1e23 electrons/cc
* $T_0 = {1, 10, 100, 1000}$ eV
* $\Delta x = {0.2, 0.5, 0.8, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0}$ nm

Seems that when The Debye Length is close to the cell size, the initial temperature does not matter too much. However, when the Debye Length is severely under-resolved it starts to matter more.

These pictures show how the heating seems to have the same rate of change regardless of initial temperature. However, we see at lower temperatures, there is a longer delay until when linear heating is reached. Maybe this is because the thermal velocity of electrons is too low for the low temperature simulations and is not able to sufficiently move around in the simulation volume in the given amount of time to cause heating. This could be related to some relevant timescale $t \sim \frac{\lambda_D}{v_\text{th}}$.

Things to do: 

1. Try to understand how Hockney came up with heating time estimates from *Computer Simulation using Particles*
2. Look into what this delay timescale might be
3. Continue working on other simulations modifying other parameters
4. Work on Modifying Gaussian Laser Beam Model to fit my data
