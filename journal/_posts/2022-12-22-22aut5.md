# Deriving Heating Model from E Field Fluctuations

[Previously](https://ronak-n-desai.github.io/osunotebook/22aut2/) I have tried to consider the Hockney calculations regarding the E-Field Fluctuations, but I did not fully examine how this would turn into a heating model. Here, I will finish the calculation. In the Hockney 1971 paper, they state a formula for the time-averaged squared electric field fluctuations (which comes from Plasma Kinetic Theory by Montgomery and Tidman Ch. 8.2)

\begin{equation} \frac{\langle E^2 \rangle}{8 \pi} = \frac{k_B T}{2} \int \int_{-\infty}^{+\infty} \frac{d k_x d k_y}{(2 \pi)^2} \frac{1}{(1 + (k_x^2 + k_y^2) \lambda_D^2)} \end{equation}

which is in units of energy per unit volume. We can convert this integral to polar coordinates by letting $k = \sqrt{k_x^2 + k_y^2}$ and integrating with respect to $k \cdot dk \cdot d\phi$. Also, we can convert the expression from CGS to SI Units

\begin{equation}
\frac{\epsilon_0 \langle E^2 \rangle}{2} = \frac{k_B T}{4 \pi} \int_0^\infty \frac{k dk}{1 + k^2 \lambda_D^2}
\end{equation}

To solve this integral, we let $u \equiv k \lambda_D$ to get

\begin{equation}
\langle E^2 \rangle = \frac{k_B T}{2 \pi \epsilon_0 \lambda_D^2} \int_0^\infty \frac{u du}{1 + u^2}
\end{equation}

which diverges at infinity, so we set limits to the integral 0 and $u_{max}$ which correspond to the maximum relevant wavenumber in our simulation. This can be solved analytically as 

\begin{equation}
\langle E^2 \rangle = \frac{k_B T}{4 \pi \epsilon_0 \lambda_D^2} \text{Log}(1 + u_max^2) \label{eq:e2}
\end{equation}

Here, $u_max = 2 \pi \frac{\lambda_D}{\Delta x} \times R$ where $R$ is some multiplicative factor that tells us where to implement our cutoff. $R = 1$ corresponds to saying that the maximum wavenumber considered is limited the the cell size: $k_max = \frac{2 \pi}{\Delta x}$. 

Also, from the Hockney 1971 Paper, they give an estimate of how the squared electric field fluctuations
