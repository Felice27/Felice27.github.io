# Explanation of Fuchs Model

I have previously explained much of the Fuchs Model [here](https://ronak-n-desai.github.io/osunotebook/22sum5/). The inputs of this model are as follows: 

- Laser Intensity (W/cm2): around $10^{17} \rightarrow 10^{19}$
- Focal Distance ($\mu m$): around $-30 \rightarrow 30$
- Target Thickness ($\mu m$): around $0.5 \rightarrow 10$

There are some other inputs that were kept as constants

- Spot Size: 2 $\mu m$
- Pulse Duration (FWHM): 40 fs

and another important parameter would be the total laser energy which can be computed from the laser intensity, spot size, and pulse duration also found [here](https://ronak-n-desai.github.io/osunotebook/22sum5/). 

The Total Proton Energy and Number of Protons would be related to the formula for dN/dE in the Fuchs Paper, and Tom's code has the implementation of how to get those things. The Paper also takes the energy in protons divided by the energy of the laser to obtain the laser conversion efficiency which is something that we'll find in the datasets as a useful quantity, but is not a parameter in the model. 

The outputs that we are trying to predict are 

- Total Proton Energy
- Max Proton Energy
- Average Proton Energy 

Where the average proton energy could be obtained from the Fuchs Model by taking the total proton energy and dividing by the number of protons.
