# Peculiarity of 10eV Sim (Cont)

Last week I tried to understand why exactly the 10eV simulations did not seem to increase heating as we increased the cell size. I decided to run some sims with 100eV for higher grid spacings: ${12, 15, 18, 25}$ nm.

From these results, it is clear that somewhere around 10nm, this relationship breaks down. For the 10eV sims from last week, it broke down around 3nm. If I were to guess, this relationship would breakdown for 1000eV around $\sqrt{10} * 10 \approx 31$ nm and for 10000eV around $100 nm$. 

Here, is a plot with 1000eV

In this plot, we start seeing the slope peak and stay constant around 25 nm. This tells me that 

# Download of Pytorch

Currently, Pytorch only supports python 3.7-3.9. By default, python 3.9 is not available on OSC, but Tom has it downloaded. So, we can use

> source /fs/project/PAS1066/zhang_anaconda/anaconda3/bin/activate

to activate conda that has python 3.9 available.

## Conda Environment

> conda env list

This will list the already created conda environments. To remove an environment, type: 

> conda env remove -n *env-name*

To create a new environment (let's call it *pytorch-env*):

> conda create -n pytorch-env python=3.9
> 
> conda activate pytorch-env

Then, we can install some supporting packages

> conda install h5py imageio jupyter matplotlib numpy tqdm

Then, we should follow instruction on https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/ to download pytorch. When downloading on OSC or Unity (or anywhere with CUDA Availability), we should check the CUDA version. to do this, we can type

> ls /usr/local/cuda

which should list all available versions of CUDA.
