# Peculiarity of 10eV Sim (Cont)

Last week I tried to understand why exactly the 10eV simulations did not seem to increase heating as we increased the cell size. I decided to run some sims with 100eV for higher grid spacings: ${12, 15, 18, 25}$ nm.

From these results, it is clear that somewhere around 10nm, this relationship breaks down. For the 10eV sims from last week, it broke down around 3nm. If I were to guess, this relationship would breakdown for 1000eV around $\sqrt{10} * 10 \approx 31$ nm and for 10000eV around $100 nm$. 

Here, is a plot with 100eV

In this plot, we start seeing the slope peak and stay constant around 25 nm.
