# Comparison of Three Methods
From the findings of my last post, I decided to both log the intensity and the output energies. I used the following hyper-parameters for each model
- NN (3x64x16x3): Epochs = 35, learning rate = 1e-3 , batch size = 32
- GPR: tolerance = 1e-4, learning rate = 1e-1
- SVR(RBF): C = 1, epsilon = 0.1, tolerance = 1e-4

### Time Comparison
First, I plotted the amount of time it would take to train a model as a function of time

We can see that the neural network takes much longer than the GPR which in turn takes much longer than the SVR. One caveat is that the SVR and GP was only running for Max Energy and not Total/Average Energy. This would effectively triple their compute times. I am working on solving for all three energies for GPR and SVR to make a better comparison.

### Error as a function of Noise Level
Interestingly enough, all three methods seem to work well for Noise levels of 10\% or greater

However, for noise levels of 5\% or less, we see the SVR perform poorly (for the 21000 point dataset). Interestingly enough, its only at this 21000 model and not most of the others

And if we look at when there is no noise at all, we still get errors for both SVR and GP

The SVR seems to converge around 5\%. Maybe this is some tolerance or epsilon value that I need to adjust. But the GPR is less clear. I need to find a way to make these regression
