# Number of Points to Train
Before candidacy, I was working on exploring different Machine Learning Models with the Fuchs Model. I found that we only needed a really small amount of points to train the model. This was in part due to an error on my part. I wasn't resetting the pytorch model parameters of the neural network in between each training split. To fix this, I just called

> torch.save(model.state_dict(), 'temp.pt')

to save the initial untrained model state and then at the beginning of each training iteration, I called

> model.load_state_dict(torch.load('temp.pt'))

to load this untrained model state. After doing this, I found that the neural network converged to a steady percentage error after around a few thousand data points of training
