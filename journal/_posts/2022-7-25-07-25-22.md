Below, I am going to summarize some of the results I obtained in the last two weeks. I used a uniform density plasma of $n = 10^{23} 1/cc$ electrons with an equal amount of protons. I made the simulation grid 20 cells in both x and y directions and used 50 computational particles per cell. I started the protons at a cold temperature of 1eV and varied the electron temperature: $T_e = {10, 100, 1000, 10000}$ eV. Additionally, I varied the cell size as $\Delta x = {1, 4, 7, 10}$ nm. These parameters explored a region where the Debye Length is under-resolved where $\Delta x / \lambda_D \in (0.007, 0.74)$ and the number of particles contained in a Debye Sphere is $N_D \in (0.17, 5463)$.
