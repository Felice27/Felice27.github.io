Below, I am going to summarize some of the results I obtained in the last two weeks. I used a uniform density plasma of $n = 10^{23}$ 1/cc electrons with an equal amount of protons. I made the simulation grid 32 cells in both x and y directions and used 50 computational particles per cell. I started the protons at a cold temperature of 1eV and varied the initial electron temperature: $T_e = {10, 100, 1000, 10000}$ eV. Additionally, I varied the cell size as $\Delta x = {1, 4, 7, 10}$ nm. These parameters explored a region where the Debye Length is under-resolved where $\lambda_D / \Delta x \in (0.007, 0.74)$ and the number of particles contained in a Debye Sphere is $N_D \in (0.17, 5463)$. 

Below are results when the full simulation volume is filled with plasma.

Since we wish to study the effects of the vacuum on the heating, I did another simulation that is restricted to a target with size of half the simulation length in each direction (a square that is 1/4 of the total area).

The issue with this simulation is the initial drop in electron temperature at the first few hundred femto seconds of the simulation. We think this is probably happening because the fast moving electrons will want to move away from the target, but are being pulled back by the stationary (by comparison) protons and so will get slowed down. However, the average energy between the protons and electrons seems to rise nearly linearly which is what we can use for a comparison. I redid these graphs for a variety of different target shapes and just plotted the average temperature over time. 

Below, I organized the plots by comparing the effect of different target size (32 x 32 refers to no vacuum) for a given grid spacing and initial temperature.

In these simulations, it seems that the larger target sizes exhibit more numerical heating.  For some of the sims with smaller targets, the electrons may be going fast and crossing the periodic boundaries before the plasma gets a chance to equilibrate.  However, the simulations with lower temperature and higher grid spacing do not follow this trend. In these sims, the electrons may not reach the boundary that quickly and the smaller target sizes would be able to expand faster, causing a higher change in temperature.

Here, it can be seen that there is more heating as $\Delta x$ increases. This is due to the Debye Length being further under-resolved which we know results in more heating from the Arber Paper. However, when the electron temperature is 10eV, this does not seem to be true. In this regime, $N_D < 1$, so the particles do not exhibit collective behavior of a normal plasma which may factor into play. Additionally, at really high electron temperature of 10keV, we see that the heating curves are not as smooth. This may be because the electrons are moving so much faster than the protons.
