Below, I am going to summarize some of the results I obtained in the last two weeks. I used a uniform density plasma of $n = 10^{23}$ 1/cc electrons with an equal amount of protons. I made the simulation grid 20 cells in both x and y directions and used 50 computational particles per cell. I started the protons at a cold temperature of 1eV and varied the initial electron temperature: $T_e = {10, 100, 1000, 10000}$ eV. Additionally, I varied the cell size as $\Delta x = {1, 4, 7, 10}$ nm. These parameters explored a region where the Debye Length is under-resolved where $\Delta x / \lambda_D \in (0.007, 0.74)$ and the number of particles contained in a Debye Sphere is $N_D \in (0.17, 5463)$. 

Below are results when the full simulation volume is filled with plasma.

Since we wish to study the effects of the vacuum on the heating, I did another simulation that is restricted to a target with size of half the simulation length in each direction (a square that is 1/4 of the total area).

The issue with this simulation is the initial drop in electron temperature at the first few hundred femto seconds of the simulation. We think this is probably happening because the fast moving electrons will want to move away from the target, but are being pulled back by the stationary (by comparison) protons and so will get slowed down. However, the energy on average between the protons and electrons seems to rise nearly linearly which is what we can use for a comparison.
