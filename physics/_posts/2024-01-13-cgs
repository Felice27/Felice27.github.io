CGS and Gaussian Units are the bane of my existence, so I decided to make a page that compiles all the useful information I can find about them in one place. 

# Base Units
The Seven SI Base Units are as follows: 

1. Time: second (s)
2. Length: metre (m)
3. Mass: kilogram (kg)
4. Current: ampere (A)
5. Temperature: Kelvin (K)
6. Amount: mole (mol)
7. Luminous Intensity: candela (cd)

The CGS system only has three base units

# Definition of CGS Gaussian Units

In the SI unit system, the quantity $\mu_0 \equiv 4 \pi \cdot 10^{-7} N/A^2$. However, the Gaussian Unit System defines the following

\[
\epsilon_0 \equiv \frac{1}{4 \pi}
