CGS and Gaussian Units are the bane of my existence, so I decided to make a page that compiles all the useful information I can find about them in one place. 

# Base Units
The Seven SI Base Units are as follows: 

1. Time: second (s)
2. Length: metre (m)
3. Mass: kilogram (kg)
4. Current: ampere (A)
5. Temperature: Kelvin (K)
6. Amount: mole (mol)
7. Luminous Intensity: candela (cd)

The CGS system only has three base units
